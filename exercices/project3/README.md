#Artist's statement

I'm sure you've heard of the saying 'An image is worth a thousand words'?
Well that was my main inspiration for this project, except my version has a
little twist. I wanted to see what image could sound like as music. Of course
this is a simple project and could be pushed much further but still. So the idea
of this project was to create a canvas on which the player could draw and then
listen to what they've drawn. I eventually also decided to add a second version
of the game in which you could write any words of letters you want and listen to
them musically, because I was curious if something like a beautiful poem could
actually sound good. I like the idea that letters placed in a random, chaotic
order could create a beautiful melody, and actual words and well formulated
sentences would sound totally chaotic.I didn't base my idea on any phylosophical
idea, but really mostly on the idea of what something non musical would sound
like if we turned it into music.

To achieve my goal, I used jquery which I quite like, and a new library that I had
never tried before called audiosynth. I needed that library to be able to have
my music notes and different instruments to play with. It was pretty easy to use,
but it's pretty basic and the default instrument don't sound particularly good,
but maybe that's simply because the music playing is pretty bad itself. But anyway,
it was easy to include in my code for a first attempt at coding with music.

Surprisingly, the hardest part to me was to create the grid in the drawing version
of the grid. After that, I managed to find the logic in the code and the solutions
surprisingly fast. Most of the ideas I had that I had never tried before worked
from the first try or almost, which I'm pretty proud of.

For the visuals, I kept it simple. In that kind of project, I believe it is more
important for me to focus on the functionality of the code instead of the visuals.
I still tried to include some details that helped to the understanding of the
functionalities. For example, I delimited the different octaves on the side of the
grid and added progression bars for each version of the game when the audio clip
is played.

Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with my project. I think I've managed to create
something interesting. At first when I was done with a first version of the drawing
game, I was worried that it would be too simple, but I believe I succeeded in adding
enough functionalities to the game to make it complete and fun to experiment with.
If I had something to add, it would be a little bit of visuals (even though I just
said it wasn't as important). I'd probably also add a way to save the clips you've
created and some kind of instructions on the homepage, even though I think the idea
is pretty straightforward.

Nevertheless, I'm proud of this project and I definitely had fun doing it, and
playing with it. I think I represented well my original idea of listening to images.
