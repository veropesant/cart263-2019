/*****************
FINAL
Drawing music is now a thing
VÃ©ronique Pesant

So the goal of this project is to create a sort of grid canvas
on which the player can create various patterns and then listen
to them. That's right. Listen. Each color is going to represent a
different note, and the different rows are going to represent
the octave.
In this final version of the project, there is two versions of the
game the player can choose from. The second game is similar to the first,
but instead of drawing, the player can use the text area to write any
text they want and then listen to it. In that version, each letter and
punctuation is a note, and depending on where they are in the alphabet
the octave increases.

const ATTACK = 0.1;
// Release time for a note (in seconds)
const RELEASE = 0.1;
