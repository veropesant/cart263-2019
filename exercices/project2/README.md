# ARTIST STATEMENT

For my game, I chose to use Phaser, because I had never worked with it before
and I thought it would interesting to explore a new technology. I don't regret my
choice, although it was more difficult than expected.

I really liked the subject of this game but I was weirdly not really inspired
when it came to choosing a theme. So I decided to create some graphics that I
liked and then try to come up with an idea. I came up with the little dinosaur
in a really cute pixel world, so it would look like a child's game at first, and
chose to use some kind of 'heavy' words to make the player jump or eat his enemy.
As I was doing my graphics, I remembered a little game that came out last year I
think, in which you had to yell to avoid obstacles and I thought it was a funny
idea, so it inspired me to use speech as commands for certain actions in my game.

I came across a few difficulties while coding my game. The first was the fact that
phaser, which was in appearance quite simple, can be quite complicated to use, when
you go beyond their basic tutorial. It's a great tool with a lot of possibilities,
but I clearly underestimated the task at hand. I should've probably started my
project earlier.

Another problem I encountered was the fact that Google censored swear words. That
meant that I wasn't able to use voice commands such as 'Shit' or 'Fuck', which was
my initial idea, but I think it turned out fine. I found ways to go around the
censorship a little bit.

For the final result, I'm quite satisfied, but I must admit there are some details
that are still bothering me. For example, the fact that I wasn't able to use
different text to display when the game is over. Or the fact that there is no reset
option to start the game over. There's also the little bug that allows the dinosaur
to kinda fly mid air, because the frame is technically touching a platform even though
most of the body is floating. Finally, there's a problem with the font, you sometimes
need to refresh the page to make the right font appear.

In the end I'm still satisfied but the perfectionist in me knows that I could've
done much better and that's a little frustrating.
