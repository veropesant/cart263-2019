# CREATIVE IDEAS

For this project, I chose a rather simple idea, which is that
of the cat and the mouse. This little game is based on the myth
of sisyphus who was sentenced to push a bolder up a hill indefinitely.
In this game, much like sisyphus, the kitty is sentenced to eat
mouses 'til the end of times.

At the beginning of the game, the cat is asked to eat all
the mouses on the screen. At first, it may look like a simple
task, but as soon as he finishes his task, he realizes that
his work is far from done. The mouses keep on reappearing,
indefinitely, and the cat is then sentenced to eat these mouses
until he dies or gets too big and explodes (those are not coded
in the game though).

Since the essay by Albert Camus talked about the concept of the
absurd, I chose to use this concept with a little twist
less philosophical and simply used it to choose an absurd main
idea: "Using a cute kitty to illustrate a philosophical concept".

For the visuals of the game, I decided to use pixel art, because
it is a style of graphics that I enjoy quite a lot, and also because
it was a way to create easy animations. Since the style in itself
is meant to be kind of jerky, I didn't need to create a lot of
drawings achieve my animation. It didn't need to be very precise
or fluid.

I did the illustrations for the animations on illustrator, but
they were highly inspired from images that I found online, since
it made the task a lot easier with a pattern to follow. Then, I
simply exported the images as PNGs and switched the sources of the
images in my script when I wanted to animate them. I know there's
other ways to animate, but it seemed like the easiest one to me,
at least for this project.

I wanted to experiment with animation a little, so that's why I
chose to created a game where the avatar was moving, instead of
something where we could drag objects around the screen, for
example. The animations were actually quite simple, since I
already knew jQuery and how to use it, but I encountered a problem
when it came to handling collisions between objects. With p5
it was pretty easy to do, but I had never done it with only
jQuery. Luckily, I found a solution pretty fast on StackOverflow
and it didn't take too long to adapt to my situation.

For the music, I chose the wii theme song, simply because I thought
was the perfect 'non-emotional', infinite song to represent the
heaviness of the life sentence the cat got. And I also added a
little chewing sound when he eats the mouses.

Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with my final project. I managed to
solve all my problems, and when I uploaded the final version,
everything was working perfectly. If I had to change anything though,
I would probably add possible actions for the cat. For example, he
could move both ways, and could choose which mouse to eat and maybe
that would trigger some funny sentences and other interactions.
I could also add difficulties each time the level resets and make it
harder for the kitty to execute his task. But I didn't have time to
do all that and I don't think it was the goal for this project. I
would also maybe change the mouses for something that a cat would
actually dislike. Since it's supposed to be a punishment, I think it
would make more sense like that, but it's a detail.
